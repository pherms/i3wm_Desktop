# i3wm_Desktop

i3 config files working with version >3.

This config is build for a 2 monitor setup and was compiled from different sources all over the internet.

Work in progress:
- get the bandwith in i3blocks working again
- applications like keepass have some weird way of rendering fonts. They look jagged edges. This needs to be fixed as well.
